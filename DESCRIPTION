Description: More about what it does (maybe more than one line)
    The goal of this package is to help the user through the process of harmonization 
    following Maelstrom standards. The user can:
    - Create an R environment where they can place files in an organized structure
    - Identify the location and content of files in your environment
    - Generate bookdown reports of individual study (input) variables
    - Read and interpret the data processing elements (harmonization rules) and generate 
      harmonized tables
    - Generate bookdown reports of harmonized variables
